This is a collection of various SSEEdit scripts. Some of them may work in other versions of xEdit, but they have not been tested.

### Installation
Simply create a sub-folder called `UrbanCMC` in the `Edit Scripts` folder of xEdit and drop all scripts there.
This is done for better organization and to avoid conflicts with other scripts.

### Usage
To apply a script, be sure to check `Include scripts from subdirectories` in the `Apply Script` dialog, or none of these will show up.

More details on how to apply the scripts can be found in their respective descriptions.

### Scripts

#### Better Spell Learning - Create Spell Patch

Can be applied to either a single mod, or your whole load order at once (which may take a minute or two).
